            <h1>Dream big</h1>
            <h3>become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Someone has rightly said that “miracles can happen when you give more importance to your dreams in front
                of your fears”. Dreams are necessary but this can only happen when you dream big with all your heart.
                Only then you will be able to achieve the big dream. As students dream to achieve good marks, make good
                friends, get support from family and do something big in life.</p>

                <p>In addition to the front- and back-ends, applications also have a database layer. This layer is the
                    application’s core and contains all the processes in database management systems, including data
                    administration, creation, deletion, and extraction. Full-stack web developers are trained to handle
                    any
                    stage of the development, from start to finish. </p>

                <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a
                    comparatively plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working
                    environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is
                    damn
                    exciting.</p>
